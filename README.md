# VS Code Dev Days — Building MCP Servers

This repository contains the base code for the workshop initially run as part of the VS Code Dev Days 2025 in Auckland, NZ. 
The MCP Server code is taken from Anthropic's [Introduction to Model Context Protocol](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/introduction-to-model-context-protocol) course.
Parts of the workshop, including the base configuration, are drawn from the [_Building an MCP Server with AI Toolkit_](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp-for-beginners/tree/main/10-StreamliningAIWorkflowsBuildingAnMCPServerWithAIToolkit) section of Microsoft's [MCP for Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp-for-beginners) curriculum.
